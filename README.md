# Vanity Plate Generator

Since moving to California, I've been enamored by the vanity plate culture. They're everywhere! Anecdotally, most seem to be intentionally obvious - abandoning the default convention for a shorter mix of letters and/or numbers to more easily express their idea.

In considering what I would want on my own vehicle, I thought it'd be fun to try and find one that's a little more incognito. My ideal plate would be one that follows the default pattern of one number, three letters, and three numbers.

This simple program imports an English dictionary and creates a text file containing all possible options for direct character replacement that match the default naming convention.

Sadly, this program does not handle abbreviations (e.g. `OMW` instead of `on my way`) or the incorporation of numbers (e.g. `365` to express something being year round).
